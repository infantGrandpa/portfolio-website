              <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                  During this time, I was working for Unity Lab Services,
                  a division of Thermo Fisher Scientific that works onsite with customers to provide lab support.
                  As pipette coordinator, my responsibilities included scheduling and preparing the client’s pipette instruments
                  for their annual calibration while ensuring all records were kept to compliance.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="initial-designs">
              <h2>Initial Designs</h2>
              <h3>Design Considerations</h3>
              <p>
                Before any wireframes could be designed, I needed to plan out how it would work.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make it as easy as possible for researchers to claim pipettes,
                I wanted to allow them the do so using their pipettes’ serial or asset (our identifier) number.
                With COVID-19, however, many researchers would only be onsite when they needed to be in the lab,
                and I couldn’t expect them to make this a priority while working on their experiments.
              </p>
              <p>
                To alleviate this issue, I chose to allow researchers to give us the physical location of their
                pipettes along with an estimate of how many they had there,
                along with any other identifying information they could provide.
                With that information, I would then be able to reconcile that with our inventory on
                my own to ensure we matched the pipettes to the correct owner.
              </p>
              <p>
                In addition to this, I had a few more requirements for this application:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Pull from our existing inventory records</li>
                <li>Accessible by anyone within the company</li>
                <li>No permission requests</li>
                <li>Save the user's email and name with every submission</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Due to these considerations,
                I decided the fastest and easiest method of implementation would be to use Microsoft PowerApps.
                The only issue, however, would be that I had never personally used this method before.
              </p>
              <h3>Wireframes</h3>
              <p>
                As this was my first foray into PowerApps,
                I played it very safe on the earliest wireframes.
                While I had never designed for PowerApps,
                I had used a few and even ran some user testing on one before.
                I stuck to what I knew it could do with no frills,
                which resulted in the below mid-fidelity wireframes.

            <div class="section" id="building">
              <h2>Building the Application</h2>
              <p>
                I wanted to start building as soon as possible.
                I needed to make sure that what I had in mind would actually work and
                that I could create it within a reasonable timeframe.
              </p>
              <p>
                Getting the first version of the application built was simple.
                PowerApps wasn’t difficult to learn,
                although I had to ignore a lot of my programming experience to understand how to assign values to anything.
              </p>
              <p>
                I opted to build only two screens: the “By Number” lookup and the “By Other” lookup.
                The “By Number” would just switch a few controls between Asset and Serial number to simplify everything.
                The biggest challenge was getting the drawer to work – but it wouldn’t be anything compared to the challenges I would face later on.
              </p>
              <p>
                I used a Microsoft Excel Online spreadsheet as the data source:
                one worksheet held our pipette inventory while another held all submissions.
                After a few days, everything seemed to be working well and I was pretty satisfied with my quick work.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="section" id="improving">
              <h2>Improving the Design</h2>
              <p>
                With things working, I turned back to the UX and UI.
                I had made the recent realization that if this were to be client-facing (which is not something we do often),
                it needed to be good.
                Not only did it need to work,
                but it needed to be easy to use and be visually appealing.
              </p>
              <p>
                This meant it was time to return to Adobe XD.
                I realized the system would be better built using flat navigation rather than the basic hierarchical navigation that was currently in place,
                which causes a small disconnect between each lookup method.
                To do so,
                I removed the “Choose Lookup Method” screen and opted to make the “Lookup by Asset Number” the
                first screen users see upon opening the app,
                which would also quickly telegraph that this was our preferred method of communication.
              </p>
              <p>
                I performed some quick user tests and made some changes to the layout:
                I distinguished the most important information from other info,
                added a location summary to the drawer,
                and clarified the plus button’s functionality.
                After adding a color scheme,
                I had finished what would be the final wireframes of the project.

              <h2>The Challenges</h2>
              <p>
                Bringing this design into PowerApps was much more challenging than anticipated.
                <strong>All</strong> of these challenges were caused because I wanted to make sure that my
                users would have the best possible experience with this app –
                it all took time, but was worth it.
              </p>
              <h3>Drop-Shadows</h3>
              <p>
                The first issue I ran into involved drop-shadows:
                none of the pre-built controls supported them.
                To get around this, I created HTML text objects and styled them using inline CSS.
                I then had to size these twice - once as an HTML object and once within the PowerApps editor.
              </p>
              <h3>Icons and Hover Controls</h3>
              <p>
                The next issue was icons.
                PowerApps has a selection of icons that Microsoft has designed and programmed
                to work as you would expect:
                icons can change upon selection, hover, and disable.
                These icons are skinny, flat, and minimalist, and ultimately, not my style.
                I only had 2 icons – one of which is on one of the most important controls within the app –
                so I wanted them to be clear and noticeable.
                However, PowerApps only allows you to import images,
                it doesn’t allow you to make them work like icons,
                meaning I couldn’t make them show feedback when users interacted with them.
              </p>
